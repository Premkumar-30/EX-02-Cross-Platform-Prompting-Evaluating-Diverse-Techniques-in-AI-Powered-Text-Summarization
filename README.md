Your goal is to determine which combination of prompting technique + platform provides the best summary in terms of:

Accuracy

Coherence

Simplicity

Speed

User experience

## Prompt:

Summarize the following 500-word article on “The Basics of Blockchain Technology” in 120–150 words for undergraduate students. Keep it clear and beginner-friendly. Please revise the summary to make it even simpler and include at least two real-world examples of blockchain applications.

## Original Passage:

Blockchain technology has become one of the most talked-about innovations of the 21st century. While it is often associated with cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, its uses go far beyond digital money. At its core, blockchain is a new way of storing, verifying, and sharing information that is secure, transparent, and decentralized.

A blockchain is like a digital ledger, similar to a notebook, but instead of being kept by one person, it is shared across thousands of computers in a network. This ledger records transactions or pieces of information in units called “blocks.” Each block contains three important things: the data (such as transaction details), a timestamp, and a unique digital fingerprint called a “hash.” Once a block is filled, it is linked to the previous one, creating a chain—hence the name blockchain.

One of the most powerful features of blockchain is that once data is recorded, it cannot easily be changed. If someone tries to tamper with a block, the hash will no longer match, and the network will quickly detect the alteration. This immutability ensures trust among participants, as everyone can see and verify the same information.

Traditional systems, like banks, rely on a central authority to confirm transactions. Blockchain removes the need for such middlemen. Instead, the network of computers—called “nodes”—works together to verify new transactions. This agreement process is known as “consensus.” Different blockchains use different consensus mechanisms. For example, Bitcoin uses “Proof of Work,” where powerful computers solve complex puzzles to validate transactions. Other systems use “Proof of Stake,” which is more energy efficient.

While cryptocurrency is the most famous application, blockchain can be used in many industries. In supply chain management, it can track the movement of goods from the factory to the customer, ensuring transparency and authenticity. In healthcare, it can store patient records securely and allow authorized doctors to access them quickly. Governments can use blockchain for secure voting systems, reducing the chances of fraud. Even artists and creators use it to protect their digital content through “NFTs” (non-fungible tokens).


Blockchain provides several benefits. It is transparent because all participants can view the same data. It is secure because of its cryptographic structure and decentralized design. It is also efficient, as it reduces the need for intermediaries, saving time and money. Additionally, it increases trust in digital transactions, which is vital in today’s online world.

Despite its potential, blockchain also faces challenges. Some systems consume large amounts of energy, especially those using Proof of Work. There are also concerns about privacy, scalability (handling many transactions at once), and government regulations. However, researchers and developers are actively working on solutions to these issues.


Blockchain is more than just the foundation of cryptocurrencies—it is a groundbreaking technology that has the potential to transform industries by making data handling more secure, transparent, and efficient. As more organizations explore its uses, blockchain is likely to play a major role in shaping the future of the digital world.

Blockchain is a digital system that records information securely and transparently without needing a central authority. Think of it as a shared online notebook where data is stored in “blocks” and linked together in a “chain.” Once information is added, it cannot be changed, which makes it trustworthy. Instead of banks or middlemen, blockchain uses a process called “consensus,” where many computers agree before new data is approved.

While most people know blockchain from Bitcoin, its uses are much wider. For example, companies use it in supply chains to track food from farms to stores, ensuring freshness and safety. In healthcare, it can securely store patient records so doctors can access accurate information without privacy risks.

Overall, blockchain makes digital transactions and data handling safer, faster, and more transparent, with potential to transform many industries.

## Summarized passage:

Blockchain is a modern way of storing and sharing information that is secure, transparent, and does not rely on a central authority like a bank. It works like a shared digital notebook, where data is stored in blocks and linked in a chain. Once information is added, it cannot be changed, making it highly trustworthy. Instead of one authority, many computers (called nodes) work together to approve new information through a process called “consensus.”

While blockchain is best known for powering cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, it has many other uses. For example, in supply chains, it tracks products from factories to stores, ensuring safety and authenticity. In healthcare, it stores patient records securely, so doctors can access accurate information. By improving security, transparency, and efficiency, blockchain has the potential to transform many industries in the future.


## Result:
Thus the Original passage is successfully summarized.
